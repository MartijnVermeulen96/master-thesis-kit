\section{Milestones and Deliverables}
% How are you going to approach your thesis project? Make a concrete plan and insert a Gantt chart describing the various (high level) tasks that you plan to tackle your research problem and write your thesis. 
%------------------------------------------------
To elaborate more on the process of the thesis, a Gantt chart is shown below to elaborate on the timings and different deadlines of the project. The thesis can be split up in 3 main parts. The proposal part, the Midterm / Main Research part \& the Assessment. Throughout these parts, different milestones and tasks will be covered. While many tasks have overlap, the chronological order in milestones is set up pretty clearly. The tasks are split up between the different research sub-questions.
