\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:researchquestions}
Resulting from this motivation, the following research questions will tried to be answered in this thesis:

\paragraph{\textit{Main Research Question:}} 
~\\\textbf{How to choose a fitting error detection algorithm for a specific relational dataset?}

~\\With the following sub-questions:
\paragraph{RQ1} What is the current state of the art and what is the performance of these tools?

\paragraph{RQ2} Is it possible to create an extensive data profile to estimate performance on unseen datasets?

\paragraph{RQ3} Is it possible to generate a ranking of tools according to their performance on unseen datasets?

\paragraph{RQ4} Do these data profiles provide more interpretability of error detection tools?

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
By answering the research questions above, the following main contributions have been made in this research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item An error detection framework with six different error detection tools
    \item A comparison study of error detection algorithms for relational data
    \item A suggestion system for error detection tools and configuration for unseen relational datasets
\end{itemize}

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}
First, in \autoref{chap:background}, the background on error detection in relational data is given. The foundational information on error types, scores and error detection benchmarking, state of the art tools and methods will be covered. Also, the background on dataset profiling and interpretability with respect to error detection will be given. 
In \autoref{chap:selectedtools}, the tools explicitly used in this research are discussed.
In \autoref{chap:methodology}, the methodology of this research is highlighted in order to answer the research questions. Specifically used datasets, error detection tools and machine learning techniques will be covered. 
In \autoref{chap:experimental_setup}, the experimental setup of this study is explained.
Then, in \autoref{chap:results}, the results of the research will be presented. 
Lastly in \autoref{chap:conclusion}, conclusions and future work will be discussed.
